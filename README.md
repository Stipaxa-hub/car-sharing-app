# Car Sharing Service

![car_intro](readme-pic/car_sharing_intro.jpg)

## Project Overview

The Car Sharing Service project is designed to revolutionize the existing, outdated paper-based car rental system. By creating an efficient, online platform for car rentals, this project improves the overall experience for both users and administrators. With support for online payments, real-time car availability, and rental tracking, the system resolves major pain points in traditional car rental services.

Our solution addresses the following key issues:
- Manual tracking of cars, users, and rentals on paper.
- No real-time view of car availability.
- Cash-only payments, with no option for credit cards or online transactions.
- Lack of a system to manage late returns and fines.

The result is a modern, efficient service that empowers administrators and enhances the user experience.

## Project Highlights

This project stands out by providing:
- **Full Automation**: From booking a car to processing payments and fines, everything is automated.
- **User-Centric Interface**: Both customers and managers have distinct, easy-to-use interfaces tailored to their specific roles.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Car inventory and rental availability are always up-to-date.
- **Modern Payment Integration**: Support for credit card payments through Stripe ensures secure and convenient transactions.
- **Scalable Solution**: The system can easily scale to accommodate growing inventory and user bases.

## Key Features

### 1. **Seamless User Experience**
Customers can register, browse available cars, book rentals, and pay online using an intuitive interface. Administrators manage the fleet, users, rentals, and payments, all from a single dashboard.

### 2. **Real-Time Car Availability**
With a live inventory management system, users can see which cars are available for rent in real-time, preventing double bookings and ensuring transparency.

### 3. **Automated Payment and Fine System**
The platform integrates with Stripe for online payments, supporting both credit cards and other payment methods. Fines for late car returns are automatically calculated and processed, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

### 4. **Role-Based Access**
Two types of users:
- **Customers**: Can browse, rent cars, and manage their profile.
- **Managers**: Oversee car listings, rental transactions, user roles, and payment processing.

### 5. **Notifications and Alerts**
Administrators are automatically notified of critical events such as new bookings, overdue returns, and successful payments through the integrated Telegram notification system. This ensures immediate action on overdue rentals and other important events.

### 6. **Rental Management**
Track and manage all active and past rentals with ease. The system provides detailed information on rental duration, car condition, return status, and overdue fines.
